                        <b>Cravee</b> serves as a platform connecting users with local shops where they can explore and order food. It's important to note that <b>Cravee</b> does not handle the delivery process. Instead, individual shops on our platform manage the delivery of the food items ordered by users.
                        <b>Cravee</b> is not liable for any delay in delivery by the individual shops and only guarantees to facilitate the order handover to the shops promptly. Any concerns or issues related to the delivery process should be directly addressed with the respective shop.
